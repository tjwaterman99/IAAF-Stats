# IAAF-Stats

This repo contains scripts for downloading data from the IAAF official website (http://www.iaaf.org), parsing the html files into a pandas dataframe, and analysis of historical athlete performance.

The scripts are stored as iPython notebook files (.ipynb) for easy viewing. 

You can view the downloaded web pages in the 'Webpages' folder. The .csv files are in the 'Results' folder. The notebooks are in the 'Scripts' folder.
