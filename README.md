# IAAF-Stats

This repo contains scripts for downloading data from the IAAF official website (http://www.iaaf.org), parsing the html files into a pandas dataframe, and some analysis of historical athlete performance.

The parsed results contain the finals of each "pure-track" event (100m - 10km) since the first IAAF world championships, held at Helsinki in 1983.

The scripts are stored as iPython notebook files (.ipynb) for easy viewing.

You can view the downloaded web pages in the 'Webpages' folder. The .csv files are in the 'Results' folder. The notebooks are in the 'Scripts' folder.
